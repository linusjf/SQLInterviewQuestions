## 𝐌𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐓𝐫𝐲: Google (Medium Level) #SQL Interview Question — Solution

You are analyzing a social network dataset at Google. Your task is to find mutual friends between two users, Karl and Hans. There is only one user named Karl and one named Hans in the dataset.

The output should contain 'user_id' and 'user_name' columns.

Understanding how to join tables in SQL is essential for effective data analysis; mastering this concept allows you to combine related data seamlessly. Give it a try!

## 𝐒𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐦𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐭:

CREATE TABLE users(user_id INT, user_name varchar(30));
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Karl'), (2, 'Hans'), (3, 'Emma'), (4, 'Emma'), (5, 'Mike'), (6, 'Lucas'), (7, 'Sarah'), (8, 'Lucas'), (9, 'Anna'), (10, 'John');

CREATE TABLE friends(user_id INT, friend_id INT);
INSERT INTO friends VALUES (1,3),(1,5),(2,3),(2,4),(3,1),(3,2),(3,6),(4,7),(5,8),(6,9),(7,10),(8,6),(9,10),(10,7),(10,9);

I have provided an explanation and query, but I encourage you to try solving it first. Later, you can check the query for reference.

## 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐐𝐮𝐞𝐫𝐲:
1. The CTEs (karl_friends and hans_friends) efficiently find all friends for Karl and Hans, respectively.

2. The main query joins these CTEs with the users table to find the users who are present in both Karl's and Hans's friend lists (mutual friends).
